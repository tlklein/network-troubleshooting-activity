# Network Troubleshooting Hands-On Activity

This repository contains a practical hands-on activity on **Network Troubleshooting** completed as part of a university course in Computer Information Systems (CIS). 
The document demonstrates essential networking tools and techniques to diagnose and resolve network-related issues.

## Project Overview

This project involves completing and documenting tasks from **Hands-On Activity 5A (CIS 2347)**. It focuses on the following areas of network troubleshooting:

- Analyzing IP configurations and connectivity using commands like `IPCONFIG`, `PING`, and `ARP`.
- Investigating Domain Name System (DNS) issues and caching mechanisms.
- Implementing advanced tools like `NSLOOKUP` and `TRACERT` to trace routes and find IP addresses.
- Identifying common failure points in network operations.

## Features

- **Detailed Command Demonstrations**:
  - Commands like `IPCONFIG /DISPLAYDNS`, `PING`, and `TRACERT` are explained with output examples.
- **Diagnostic Insights**:
  - How tools like `ARP` and `DNS Cache` contribute to resolving network inefficiencies.
- **Failure Analysis**:
  - Comprehensive listing of potential failure points in a request lifecycle, including AWS-specific issues like:
    - DNS resolution and API gateway failures.
    - Misconfigurations in IAM policies and VPC settings.
    - Issues with services like ELB, EC2, and RDS.
